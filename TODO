    Responsive Design: Bootstrap framework provides a responsive layout that works well on various devices and screen sizes.
    GDPR Compliance Check: Integration of GDPR compliance reminders and checkboxes ensures that users are aware of data protection measures.

What Did Not Work or Needs Improvement:

    PDF pages cutting off unnecessary
    Section 6.1 Functionality: On page_7.html, the implementation for Section 6.1 is not functioning as expected. It is intended to ensure that users confirm all required supplementary documentation, but it appears that the associated radio buttons or checklist interactions are not working correctly.

    Completed Aspects

    Form Layout and Structure: The multi-page HTML structure is complete, ensuring users can progress through different sections logically.
    Styling: The application uses Bootstrap and custom CSS for styling, providing a consistent and visually appealing interface.
    Basic JavaScript Interactions: Functions like PDF generation, form validation for completion, and resetting the form are implemented.
    Local Storage Utilization: Uses localStorage to save and retrieve user input across different form sections, preventing data loss during navigation.
    Responsive Design: The form is responsive, working effectively across different devices and screen sizes.
    GDPR Compliance Elements: Includes GDPR-related checkboxes and information to ensure users are aware of data protection practices.

    Advanced Input Validation: The form lacks advanced input validation for formats like emails and dates, which could prevent incorrect data submissions.
    Error Handling and User Feedback: Needs more detailed feedback mechanisms for errors during form submission or incorrect data entry.
    User Authentication: No user authentication mechanism is in place to protect user data or restrict access.
    Comprehensive Data Export: Initially lacking broader data export options; only PDF output was available with suggestions for adding JSON export later.
    Dynamic Content Interaction: Limited dynamic content generation, such as auto-filling fields based on prior inputs or adaptive content based on user selections.

Recommendations for Future Development

    Implement detailed input validation to ensure data accuracy and format correctness.

Here's a detailed note on the validation aspects implemented and suggestions for improvements in the research ethics application form:
Implemented Validation Details

    Required Fields: The form uses HTML attributes to ensure that essential fields are not left blank.
    Checkbox and Radio Button Validation: Ensures that at least one option is selected where multiple choices are provided, critical for adherence to ethical standards.
    Form Submission Checks: JavaScript functions check that all required fields are filled before allowing the user to proceed to the next section or submit the form.
    Local Storage Checks: Ensures data persistence across sessions by storing user inputs in localStorage, which also helps in retaining form state during navigation.

Validation Aspects Needing Improvement

    Field-Specific Data Formats: The form currently lacks validation for specific data types like email addresses, phone numbers, and date formats. Implementing regex-based validation could enhance data integrity.
    Error Messaging: While the form validates presence, it does not provide specific error messages related to the reason for validation failure, which could guide users more effectively.
    Dynamic Validation: As users fill out the form, immediate feedback on the correctness of the entered data could improve the user experience and reduce submission errors.
    Cross-Field Validation: There is no mechanism to ensure consistency among related data fields (e.g., ensuring end dates are not before start dates).

Recommendations for Enhanced Validation

    Implement Regex for Data Format Validation: Use regular expressions to ensure that entries like emails, dates, and phone numbers meet a specific format.
    Detailed Error Messages: Provide contextual error messages directly next to the form fields to inform users about what needs to be corrected without generalizing the error.
    Real-Time Validation Feedback: Introduce JavaScript or jQuery scripts to provide immediate validation feedback as soon as a user exits a form field, improving interaction and correcting mistakes early.
    Consistency Checks Across Fields: Add logic to compare values across different fields to ensure logical consistency and prevent contradictory inputs.
    The DCU Research Ethics Application website is designed to facilitate the submission of ethical review forms for research projects involving human participants. Here’s how the website can be utilized by users, detailing the user interactions and the flow of information:
