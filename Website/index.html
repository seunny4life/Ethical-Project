            Any queries relating to this form should be e-mailed to the DCU Research
            Ethics Committee (REC) at <a href="mailto:rec@dcu.ie">rec@dcu.ie</a>.
            The REC Review Process is outlined in the Information and Guidance
            section of the DCU Research Ethics webpage.

            Please note that the REC is not responsible for overseeing insurance
            requirements. Applicants should refer to the DCU Insurance webpage for
            guidance. It is incumbent upon every applicant to ensure that the
            appropriate insurance cover is in place for their project.
        </p>

            If your research involves collecting or processing personal data, you
            must first complete the DCU online Data Protection training course and
            review the “Data Protection – Key Points for DCU Researchers” guidance
            from the Data Protection Unit to assist you in meeting your legal
            obligations under GDPR and associated Irish law.
        </p>
        <p>
            If your research requires approval from the Biological Safety Committee
            (BSC) this must be in place prior to REC submission. Contact
